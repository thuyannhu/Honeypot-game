# Honeypot

Hello! 

This project is my submission for the problem set 0 of Harvard course CS50.
In this game, you are going to help Ben the Bear gather enough honey to last during winter. 
I designed the code, the arts and the sound effects.

This game needs to be run on Scratch, once you clicked the [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/832012341), click on the green flag and enjoy!
Good luck!
